# Contributing to Opdex V1 API

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug

- Discussing the current state of the code

- Submitting a fix

- Proposing new features

- Becoming a maintainer

### We follow [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), so all code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests. [Early pull requests](https://carlosperez.medium.com/pull-request-first-f6bb667a9b6) are a good idea, especially if it’s a large change. If you want to submit a change, feel free to start a draft pull request before completing, or even starting the work:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from main.

2. Begin writing your code, or create an empty commit to start off your work. `git commit --allow-empty -m "Start of [thing you're working on]."`

3. Create a draft pull request with a description of the changes that you wish to make.

4. Make commits in small incremental steps with clear descriptions for your changes.

5. Ensure you include tests and that the test suite passes.

6. Be open to feedback and comments from maintainers.

7. When it is ready to merge, request a review and tag a maintainer.

### Use consistent coding style

Code styling guidelines are defined in the .editorconfig file. Most code editing software can be configured to follow the guidelines outlined in this file.

### Discuss the code with us

You can [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/PSJr4Ns85k) to discuss any code changes, new features, or bugs with us via our development channels. Alternatively open a new GitHub issue and we will be happy to respond.
